As the brief description indicates, this is built to produce three Annotation Scripts for three of the large tables used in the game No Man's Sky. These are the Technology, Product, and Substance Tables. Currently these ***do not*** annotate the substances/products used to charge and/or craft equipment/tech/products, as I had trouble figuring out a way to write this to do so.

Nevertheless, it *does* annotate the names of every Technology, Product, and Substance in these tables, which should prove helpful in translating the charging/crafting requirements.

At the moment, I'm currently considering adding a fourth script to be generated for the Alien Puzzle Table, but I decided this was a solid start. Hope you may find this useful!

P.S. Remember to open each generated script and set ET.Parse to target the correct files (however you have them named, if differing from the vanilla, decompiled names). 

Also, the Product script will require you to escape the apostrophes for a few products for it to work properly. The specific products are noted in a comment at the top of the script, so please make sure to keep this in mind before running it!
